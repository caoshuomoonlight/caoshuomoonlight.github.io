Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department of J.B. Speed School of Engineering at the University of Louisville. I received my PhD in Information Sciences and Technology from the Pennsylvania State University in August 2023.

My research interests span the areas of **computer vision**, **machine learning**, **human-computer interaction**, and **robotics**. My research employs a hybrid approach integrating data-driven learning and human-centered design to address major human-centric challenges.
